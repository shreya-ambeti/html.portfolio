<h1>The Best Horror Movies According to Shreya</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<h3>1. SAW </h3>
<p>This is a collection of movies and is psychologically gross, chilling and horrifying. The most interesting part is the connectiveness of all the parts of the movies</p>
<h3>2. The Conjuring</h3>
<p> This movie is based on true events where a doll named Annabelle is the ghost. It has a collection of parts and is again all connected</p>
<h3>3. The Evil Dead</h3>
